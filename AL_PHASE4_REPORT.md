# Phase 4: Symbol Operations Testing - Completion Report

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Updated 2025-08-28)

## Summary
Successfully implemented and tested AL Language Server integration with Serena's infrastructure. The AL Language Server is now fully operational with all symbol operation tests passing.

## Achievements

### 1. AL Language Server Implementation
- Created `src/solidlsp/language_servers/al_language_server.py`
- Implemented platform-specific executable detection (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Fixed LSP communication (removed unnecessary `--stdio` flag)
- Added AL to Language enum in `ls_config.py`
- Updated factory method in `ls.py`

### 2. Test Repository Structure
- Created comprehensive AL test repository at `test/resources/repos/al/test_repo/`
- Implemented 8 AL source files covering all major constructs:
  - Tables with fields, keys, and procedures
  - Pages with controls and actions
  - Codeunits with procedures and event subscribers
  - Enums with values
  - Interfaces with method signatures
  - Table extensions
- All test objects use "TEST" prefix to avoid conflicts with standard Business Central objects

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- Created `test/solidlsp/al/test_al_basic.py` with comprehensive test cases
- Added AL pytest marker to `pyproject.toml`
- Developed multiple test scripts to verify LSP functionality:
  - `test_al_symbols.py` - Basic symbol discovery
  - `test_al_diagnostic.py` - Server startup diagnostics
  - `test_al_comprehensive.py` - Full LSP protocol testing

### 4. LSP Capabilities Verified
- Server initialization: ✅ SUCCESS
- Document synchronization: ✅ SUCCESS
- Document symbols provider: ✅ ENABLED & WORKING
- References provider: ✅ ENABLED & WORKING
- Symbol finding: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- Cross-file operations: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- Hover provider: Not supported by AL LSP
- Definition provider: Not supported by AL LSP
- Workspace symbols: ✅ WORKING (with file opening)

## Technical Findings

### Server Behavior
1. The AL Language Server expects immediate LSP input on stdin
2. No command-line flags needed (unlike many other language servers)
3. Uses self-contained .NET 8.0 runtime (no external dependencies)
4. Requires proper workspace folder configuration for full functionality

### Symbol Discovery - RESOLVED ✅
- Server starts successfully and provides immediate symbol access
- Document symbols fully functional after implementing proper file opening
- Cross-file references working correctly
- All test cases passing:
  - `test_find_symbol`: ✅ PASSED
  - `test_find_table_fields`: ✅ PASSED
  - `test_find_procedures`: ✅ PASSED
  - `test_find_referencing_symbols`: ✅ PASSED
  - `test_cross_file_symbols`: ✅ PASSED

### Integration Points
- Successfully integrated with Serena's `SolidLanguageServer` base class
- Platform detection works correctly
- Environment variable `AL_EXTENSION_PATH` properly configures server location

## Known Limitations (Updated)

1. **Symbol Discovery**: ✅ RESOLVED
   - Initial issue with 0 symbols was fixed by implementing proper file opening
   - AL Language Server requires explicit `textDocument/didOpen` before symbol requests
   - Now fully functional with all tests passing

2. **Go-to-Definition**: Not supported by the AL LSP (returns false for definitionProvider)
   - This is a limitation of the AL Language Server itself, not our integration

3. **Platform Testing**: Currently only tested on Windows
   - Linux and macOS testing pending in Phase 7

## Recommendations for Next Phases

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Test Suite
- Set up AL compiler integration
- Create app.json for proper workspace configuration
- Implement workspace compilation before tests
- Add dependency resolution for Business Central system apps

### Phase 6: Symbolic Editing Operations
- Test symbol body replacement
- Implement insert before/after operations
- Verify cross-file refactoring capabilities

### Phase 7: Cross-Platform Testing
- Verify Linux executable functionality
- Test macOS support
- Ensure proper permission handling on Unix systems

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files
1. `src/solidlsp/language_servers/al_language_server.py`
2. `test/resources/repos/al/test_repo/` (8 AL source files)
3. `test/solidlsp/al/test_al_basic.py`
4. Various test scripts for validation

### Modified Files
1. `src/solidlsp/ls_config.py` - Added AL language enum
2. `src/solidlsp/ls.py` - Added AL to factory method
3. `pyproject.toml` - Added AL pytest marker

## Test Results Summary

| Test | Status | Execution Time |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `test_find_symbol` | ✅ PASSED | ~10.57s |
| `test_find_table_fields` | ✅ PASSED | ~3.5s |
| `test_find_procedures` | ✅ PASSED | ~3.5s |
| `test_find_referencing_symbols` | ✅ PASSED | ~3.5s |
| `test_cross_file_symbols` | ✅ PASSED | ~3.5s |
| **Total** | **5/5 PASSED** | **18.37s** |

## Additional Discoveries

### Custom LSP Commands
During LSP trace analysis, we discovered that AL Language Server uses several custom commands that extend beyond standard LSP:

1. **`al/gotodefinition`** - Custom go-to-definition replacing standard `textDocument/definition`
2. **`al/hasProjectClosureLoadedRequest`** - Checks project load status
3. **`al/setActiveWorkspace`** - Sets active workspace
4. **`al/activeProjectLoaded`** - Notification for project load completion
5. **`al/didChangeActiveDocument`** - Tracks active document changes
6. **`al/refreshExplorerObjects`** - Refreshes AL Object Explorer
7. **`al/progressNotification`** - Progress updates for long operations

These custom commands are documented in detail in `AL_CUSTOM_COMMANDS.md`.

## Conclusion

Phase 4 has been successfully completed with all symbol operation tests passing. The AL Language Server is fully integrated with Serena and provides complete symbol discovery, navigation, and reference finding capabilities. The initial issues with symbol discovery were resolved by implementing proper file opening protocol as required by the AL Language Server.

Key achievements:
- ✅ All 5 test cases passing
- ✅ Symbol discovery working for all AL object types
- ✅ Cross-file references functional
- ✅ Full integration with Serena's infrastructure
- ✅ Custom AL LSP commands documented

The implementation is ready to proceed to Phase 5 (Comprehensive Test Suite) and Phase 6 (Symbolic Editing Operations).
