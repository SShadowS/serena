## Overview
This document outlines a phased approach to integrate AL (Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central) language support into Serena. Each phase includes specific tasks, deliverables, and success criteria.

---

## Phase 0: Fix Critical URI Mismatch ~~(URGENT)~~
**Duration:** 1 day  
**Goal:** Resolve URI mismatch preventing symbol extraction
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (Issue was fixed by proper file opening implementation)

### Tasks
1. **Implement Direct Symbol Request**
   - [x] ~~Override request_document_symbols to bypass parent method~~ Not needed
   - [x] Ensure exact URI match between didOpen and documentSymbol (Resolved via proper file opening)
   - [x] Add comprehensive URI logging (Added in ALLanguageServer)
   - [x] Test with simple AL file

2. **Verify Symbol Extraction**
   - [x] Confirm AL symbols (not just file symbols) are returned
   - [x] Test with Customer.Table.al 
   - [x] Verify procedures, fields, enums are found
   - [x] Document working configuration

### Success Criteria
- ✅ AL Language Server returns actual code symbols (tables, procedures, fields)
- ✅ Tests can find "TEST Customer" and other AL objects
- ✅ Document symbols return non-empty results

### Resolution
The URI mismatch issue was resolved by implementing proper file opening protocol in the ALLanguageServer class. The AL Language Server requires explicit `textDocument/didOpen` notifications before symbol requests, which was successfully implemented.
