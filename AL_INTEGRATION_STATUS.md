# AL Language Server Integration Status

## Current State

The AL Language Server integration for Serena has been implemented with the following components:

1. **ALLanguageServer class** (`src/solidlsp/language_servers/al_language_server.py`)
   - Properly locates and starts the AL Language Server executable
   - Implements AL-specific initialization sequence
   - Overrides `request_full_symbol_tree` and `request_document_symbols` to handle AL's file opening requirements

2. **Language Configuration**
   - AL language registered in `ls_config.py` with file extensions `.al` and `.dal`
   - Factory method added to `ls.py` to instantiate ALLanguageServer

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Test repository created with sample AL code (`test/resources/repos/al/test_repo/`)
   - Test suite implemented (`test/solidlsp/al/test_al_basic.py`)
   - pytest marker added for AL tests

## Known Issues

### Symbol Extraction Limitations

The AL Language Server behaves differently from other language servers:

1. **File-Level Symbols Only**: The server returns file symbols (kind: 1) but not the actual AL code symbols within files (tables, codeunits, procedures, etc.)

2. **Document Symbols Return Empty**: Even after explicitly opening files with `textDocument/didOpen`, requesting document symbols returns empty results

3. **Workspace Symbols Limited**: The workspace symbol search doesn't return AL-specific constructs

### Root Cause Analysis

Based on investigation and testing:

1. The AL Language Server requires a very specific initialization sequence that may include:
   - Business Central workspace setup
   - Package dependencies resolution
   - Compilation context initialization

2. The server may require:
   - Valid Business Central license
   - Specific runtime version compatibility
   - Additional configuration beyond standard LSP

3. The server appears to be tightly coupled with the VS Code AL extension environment and may not work fully in standalone LSP mode

## Current Capabilities

What works:
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ Server responds to LSP requests
- ✅ File discovery and directory structure navigation
- ✅ Basic project loading

What doesn't work:
- ❌ AL code symbol extraction (tables, codeunits, procedures, etc.)
- ❌ Symbol-based navigation and editing
- ❌ Cross-file reference finding
- ❌ Semantic operations on AL code

## Recommendations

### Short-term

1. **Document Limitations**: Clearly document that AL support is experimental and limited to file-level operations

2. **Adjust Tests**: Modify tests to reflect current capabilities rather than expected full functionality

3. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using pattern-based search and regex operations for AL files as a fallback

### Long-term

1. **Deeper Integration**: Investigate the full VS Code AL extension initialization to understand missing components

2. **Microsoft Collaboration**: Consider reaching out to Microsoft AL team for guidance on standalone LSP usage

3. **Alternative Servers**: Look for alternative AL language servers or parsers that might provide better standalone support

4. **Custom Parser**: Consider implementing a basic AL parser for symbol extraction if no suitable LSP solution exists

## Testing

To test the current AL integration:

```bash
# Run AL-specific tests (will show current limitations)
uv run pytest test/solidlsp/al/test_al_basic.py -v

# Debug script to see actual server behavior
uv run python test_al_debug.py
```

## Environment Setup

For AL Language Server to work:

1. Download VS Code AL extension (ms-dynamics-smb.al)
2. Extract to a local directory
3. Set `AL_EXTENSION_PATH` environment variable or place in project root
4. Ensure proper platform binaries are available (Windows/Linux/macOS)

## Conclusion

While the AL Language Server integration is technically functional (server starts and responds), it doesn't provide the symbol extraction capabilities needed for Serena's semantic operations. This appears to be a limitation of running the AL Language Server outside its intended VS Code environment.

The integration serves as a foundation that could be improved with:
- More complete understanding of AL server requirements
- Potential workarounds for missing initialization steps
- Alternative approaches for AL code analysis
